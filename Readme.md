# Make-project

Just a small manager for my mostly common project types!
Feel free to update it with your personal workflow to start a project

### How to run

First of all install globally ZX

```bash
npm install --global zx
```

then run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then rename the `.env.yaml.dist` in `.env.yaml` and compile the `PROJECTSDIR` parameter with the folder where you store your projects.


Now you can run:

```bash
zx ./make.mjs
```
